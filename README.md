# Code Class Structured Data

## Getting Started

**Get a copy**

    $ git clone git@github.com:sveroude/code-class-structured-data.git

**Install project dependencies**

    $ npm install

**Start a local server**

    $ npm run start

## Expose your local server to the internet 

After starting the local server (http://localhost:3000), use the
command line to request a tunnel to your local server:

    $ lt --port 3000

You will receive a url, for example https://gqgh.localtunnel.me, that
you can share with anyone for as long as your local instance of lt 
remains active. Any requests will be routed to your local service at
the specified port.
